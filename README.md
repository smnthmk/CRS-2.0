## System Summary

### Problem Statement

The current UPV CRSIS suffers from critical infrastructure issues, poor user experience, and inability to handle peak enrollment traffic, resulting in system crashes during crucial registration periods that affect thousands of students.
 
### Solution 

A modern, scalable, and resilient web application redesign leveraging contemporary cloud-native technologies to ensure reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.
 

### New Features
- Students can now see during course enlistment whether taking a course would cause a conflict with their current schedule
- Direct payment of tuition and other fees through the portal (no more separate Maya QR workaround)

### Fixes
- Improved UI and placements of navigation elements (— replaced the outdated newspaper layout)
- Unified portal experience — document requests, schedules, grades, and payments in one place instead of scattered across separate pages
- Bigger text and visual weight to improve visual hierarchy, making key information easier to scan

### CRS 1.0 Issues vs. CRS 2.0 Solutions
#### Numerous issues have been identified and reported in CRS 1.0 Here is how CRS 2.0 solves each problem:


| Issue | CRS 1.0 | CRS 2.0 Solution |
|:--------:|---------|------------------|
| **Schedule conflicts** | No detection (students discover conflicts after enlisting the course) | Real-time conflict checker warns before adding courses |
| **Tuition payment** | Separate Maya QR workaround (leave the portal, use third-party app) | Direct payment integration (pay without leaving CRS) |
| **User interface** | Outdated newspaper layout (poor visual hierarchy) | Modern responsive UI (clear visual weight and navigation) |
| **Portal experience** | Scattered across multiple pages (grades, schedules, documents in different places) | Unified dashboard (everything in one place) |
| **Transaction speed** | Slow processing (long wait times, even crashes during peak enrollment) | Optimized backend through async processing with caching |
| **Text readability** | Small hard-to-read text | Larger text and improved typography |
| **No Real-Time Updates** | Must refresh to see course availability or schedule changes | Live updates on seat counts, schedule changes, and enrollment confirmations |


## 🛠️ CRS 2.0 — Tech Stack

### 🎨 Frontend Tools

The frontend is primary built with **Next.js**, a modern React-based framework that supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) — ensuring fast, reliable page loads even during peak enrollment periods. The stack is designed for type safety, consistent UI, and real-time data updates, making it ideal for a high-traffic university system.

### ⚙️ Backend Tools
 
The backend is powered by **NestJS** on top of **Node.js**, providing a modular, scalable, and TypeScript-first architecture. It exposes a hybrid API layer — combining **GraphQL** for complex data queries and **REST** for action-based operations — to serve the diverse needs of students, faculty, and administrators efficiently.

| Logo | Technology | Role | Why We Chose It |
|:----:|------------|------|-----------------|
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/nodedotjs/339933" width="24"/> | **Node.js** | Runtime Environment | Non-blocking I/O handles hundreds of simultaneous enrollment requests without stalling — critical during peak enrollment windows. |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/nestjs/E0234E" width="24"/> | **NestJS** | Backend Framework | Enforces modular architecture (e.g., `EnrollmentModule`, `GradesModule`, `AuthModule`). More structured and scalable than raw Express.js as the system grows. |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/graphql/E10098" width="24"/> | **GraphQL** *(Apollo Server)* | Complex Data Queries | Lets the student dashboard fetch name, GPA, schedule, and units in a single request — reducing unnecessary API calls and over-fetching. |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/swagger/85EA2D" width="24"/> | **REST API** *(OpenAPI/Swagger)* | Action-Based Operations | Used for file uploads, payment webhooks, grade submissions, and admission forms — clear HTTP methods for transactional operations. |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/passport/34E27A" width="24"/> | **Passport.js** | API Authentication | Protects backend API endpoints. Handles JWT and session-based auth, integrates with UP SSO on the server side. |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/zod/3E67B1" width="24"/> | **Zod** | Backend Validation | Validates all incoming API requests and GraphQL inputs on the server side — never trusts data from the client. |

### 🗄️ Database
 
CRS 2.0 uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary relational database — chosen for its ACID compliance, relational integrity, and powerful features like triggers and full-text search. **Prisma ORM** sits on top to provide type-safe queries and clean schema migrations. **PgBouncer** is added to handle connection pooling under high concurrency.

| Logo | Technology | Role | Why We Chose It |
|:----:|------------|------|-----------------|
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/postgresql/4169E1" width="24"/> | **PostgreSQL** | Primary Database | ACID-compliant transactions prevent double enrollments and lost records. Supports complex relationships: students, courses, prerequisites, schedules, and grades. |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/prisma/2D3748" width="24"/> | **Prisma ORM** | Database Access Layer | Auto-generates TypeScript types from the DB schema for type-safe queries. Handles migrations with rollback support and includes a visual DB explorer (Prisma Studio). |
| <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/postgresql/4169E1" width="24"/> | **PgBouncer** | Connection Pooler | Acts as a proxy between NestJS and PostgreSQL — prevents connection exhaustion when hundreds of students submit requests simultaneously. |

---
 
### ⚡ Background Jobs & Caching

Enrollment requests are processed asynchronously using **Bull** queues backed by **Redis** — so no request is lost even under heavy load. Two separate Redis instances are used: one for volatile caching and one for persistent job queuing.

## Hosting
**Overview**

CRS 2.0 will adopt a hybrid hosting strategy, combining primarily on-premise infrastructure with selective cloud-based services. This approach balances cost efficiency, data security, and modern development practices while leveraging the university’s existing hardware resources.

**Primary Hosting: On-Premise Infrastructure**

The core CRS 2.0 system—including the backend API, application services, and database will be deployed on university-managed servers. To modernize deployment and improve scalability, the system will use:

* Docker for containerization
* Kubernetes (K8s) or a lightweight distribution such as K3s for orchestration
* Nginx as the web server and reverse proxy
* PostgreSQL as the primary database

This setup allows the system to run efficiently on existing infrastructure while enabling modular, scalable, and maintainable deployments.

**Key Advantages:**

* Cost efficiency: Utilizes existing hardware, minimizing new capital expenditure
* Data sovereignty: Sensitive student data remains within university premises
* Operational continuity: Aligns with current IT team expertise
* Scalability: Additional nodes can be added as needed

**Secondary Hosting: Selective Cloud Services**

Cloud services will be used only where they provide clear operational benefits, without storing sensitive data externally.

**Included Services:**

* Content Delivery Network (CDN):
Used for caching and delivering static assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) to improve load times and provide DDoS protection
* CI/CD Pipeline:
Cloud-based tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) will automate testing and deployment, reducing manual overhead and improving development speed
* Monitoring and Logging:
  A self-hosted observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and Sentry) provides 
  full system visibility — covering metrics collection, dashboards, centralized logging, 
  and error tracking — without relying on external cloud services.

**Rationale for Hybrid Approach**

The hybrid model is selected to achieve the following:
* Lower long-term costs compared to full cloud deployment
* Improved security and compliance by keeping critical data on-premise
* Modern development workflow through CI/CD and containerization
* Reduced vendor lock-in, maintaining flexibility for future migration
* Enhanced performance via CDN and optimized infrastructure

**Deployment Strategy**

Implementation will follow a phased rollout:
* Phase 1: Containerize services and deploy alongside the existing system
* Phase 2: Expand infrastructure and gradually migrate data and users
* Phase 3: Complete transition and decommission the legacy system

This phased approach ensures minimal disruption and allows rollback if necessary.
